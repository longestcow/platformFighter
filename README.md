CS20 Final Project  
All the code is inside Assets//Scripts  
The .meta files are made by unity so open the .cs files instead to look at the code.  


o A journal or log that has a minimum of 20 hoursâ€™ worth of information (recorded hourly). This  
includes plans, ideas, changes, challenges, solutions, and more. -  https://www.notion.so/invite/cb2119e3e8cc95fcfa0de67a0f0b540e3d629610  
o User Input - Controller Input  
o Variables - done  
o A while loop - Unity doesn't really like while loops but I guess a substitue could be Coroutines which  
are just functions that run on seperate threads from the main thread, and can be used to execute something after some delay.  
o A for loop - done
o An if/elif statement - done    
o Fruitful functions - done   
o An accumulator pattern - done   
o A string method (slicing, indexing, traversing, L-system, etc.) - in hitboxCollision.cs where it gets a substring to see if the name matches with another string. also used startsWith()  
o A list method - The target group stuff for camera movement is pretty much a list of the two players which are to be kept in view
