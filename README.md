# platformFighter
CS20 Final Project  
All the code is inside Assets//Scripts  
The .meta files are made by unity so open the .cs files instead to look at the code.   
  
# How To Run  
Download the CSProject folder and run "platformFighter.exe".  
Microsoft antivirus has a thing against this game but there's no virus you just have to trust me
